Before you run the program change the directory to thesaurus and type make into console to build the thesaurus scripts. You only should need to do this once

To include all dependancies run this g++ script, replace programName.cpp with the name of your file and executableName with the desired name of the executable to be generated

----------------------------------------------------------

g++ <programName.cpp> -o <executableName> hash_functions/md2.cpp hash_functions/md4.cpp hash_functions/md5.cpp hash_functions/sha1.cpp thesaurus/mythes.cxx -std=c++14
